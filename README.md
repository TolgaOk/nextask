## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TolgaOk/nextask/main/install | bash -s -- --version 0.2.0-alpha

## Usage

Train on a remote machine while you keep working locally. Keep a copy of your code and save your results to S3:

Git, S3, and which files to upload are set in config. Passwords and keys stay in environment variables.
